*** In all cases, you should at *least* restart any daemons that look up
*** users, such as ssh, nscd, cron, etc.  It's best if you simply reboot
*** unless you know the complete list of daemons to restart.

0.7a -> 0.8

0.5 -> 0.6
    No changes are needed on your part.  Simply install the new version!

0.4 -> 0.5
    NOTE: This included a lot of redesign/rewriting.  It's very possible
          I broke something that used to work.  Please report bugs to me.

    Debugging support has been removed - for now.  The config option
    'debug_flags' is now ignored.
    The syslog config options, 'facility' and 'priority' have been removed.
    Specify the facility at build time using the --with-log-facility
    option to the 'configure' program.
    Not that it really eats that many CPU cycles, but I recommend
    deleting those 3 configuration options from your config file.

    Since this version supports initgroups, the design of the group
    database needs to be altered.  You *must* alter your database/data
    in order for groups to work.  If you're not using groups, then you can
    stop reading.
    * First, alter your database such that you have a way to associate
      gids with a username.  Check the sample database for the 'grouplist'
      table to see what I mean.
    * Second, populate this new table with the appropriate data.
    * Third, REMOVE the fourth column in your SELECT statements for the
      getgr* configuration entries (getgrnam, getgrgid, & getgrent)
    * Fourth, add two new configuration entries for 'memsbygid' and
      'gidsbymem'.  See the new sample configuration file for examples.
    * Fifth, when you're comfortable you've converted the data, you can
      remove the fourth column mentioned above from your database - it's no
      longer needed.
    Two select calls will be made when retrieving group information - one
    for the getgr* call, and another to fetch the list of usernames that
    are members of that group (using the memsbygid call).
    The gidsbymem call is used for initgroups support.  This allows the
    system to find out all the groups a user is a member of *much* more
    efficiently.  In fact, some programs ONLY do it this way, and weren't
    seeing the supplemental groups users were in - until now.

0.3 -> 0.4
    First, you should note that the code currently supports only TWO
    servers.  That's easily changed, and I'll probably up it to a
    default of THREE later, but 0.4 is released with support for TWO.
    That said, the [server] section in BOTH of your config files must
    be changed to either [primary] or [secondary] as appropriate.  See
    the sample config files if it's not clear.

0.2 -> 0.3
    Simply change any '%d' you have in your configs to '%u'
