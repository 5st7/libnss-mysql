MySQL for NSS systems
=====================

Please read the file INSTALL for generic installation details.

For the impatient:
    On modern systems, you should just be able to
        ./configure
        make
        make install
    You'll probably have to add /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf (Linux)
    Solaris, I don't know yet :-)
    Edit nss_mysql.cfg and nss_mysql_root.cfg (/usr/local/etc)
    Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf and add 'mysql' to passwd/shadow/group
    Enjoy!

    On systems with older or nonstandard MySQL installations, you may
    need to use the --with-mysql-lib and/or --with-mysql-inc options.


Debugging:
    Configure with --enable-debug[=FILE].  FILE defaults to /tmp/debug
    DO NOT LEAVE DEBUG SUPPORT COMPILED IN.  IT IS A SECURITY HAZZARD

    Since there's a lot of debugging messages, you can pick which
    type(s) you want.  Set the environment variable DEBUG_NSS to be the sum
    of the options below you want:

    ERRORS                              1
    MEMORY (malloc, free, etc)          2
    FUNCTION (enter/exit w/ status)     4
    CONNECT (MySQL connect/disconnect)  8
    QUERY (MySQL queries)               16
    PARSE (File parsing)                32
    FILE (File opening/closing)         64

    For example, if you want all options, set DEBUG_NSS to 127
    If you want just CONNECT, set it to 8.  If you want CONNECT
    and QUERY, set it to 24.

    Note that debugging applies ONLY to the process that has
    this environment variable set.  The entire system WILL NOT
    debug to that file.  If you need to debug a daemon, set it
    in the init script or in the xinetd conf etc.

Solaris support:
    Coming soon.  It actually compiles on my Solaris 8 x86 box, but
    I have NOT implemented the interface Solaris requires yet.


Tested with:
    Corel (1.something - Debian 2.1) and MySQL 3.21.33b
    RedHat 6.1 and MySQL 3.20.something
    RedHat 7.1 and MySQL 3.23.49a
    RedHat 7.2 and MySQL 3.23.49a
    RedHat 7.3 and MySQL 3.23.49a
