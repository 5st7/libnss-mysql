MySQL for NSS systems
=====================
Supported Operating Systems:
    o Linux
    o FreeBSD (5.1+)

Supported MySQL Versions:
    o Recently tested on MySQL 5.7 and 8.0, but should run fine on older versions.

Prerequisites
=============
    o Installing from source:
      o A functional compile environment (system headers, C compiler, ...)
      o MySQL client library & header files (local)
      o MySQL server (local or remote)

    o Installing from RPM:
      o MySQL server (local or remote)

    o Installing from FreeBSD Port
      o MySQL client library (local)
      o MySQL server (local or remote)

The details
===========
    o If installing from source:
      o ./configure
      o make
      o make install
      If your MySQL installation is based in strange directory, use
      the --with-mysql=DIR option of ./configure to specify.  For example,
      "./configure --with-mysql=/usr2"

    o Edit /etc/libnss-mysql.cfg and /etc/libnss-mysql-root.cfg.

    o Add data to MySQL. The default configs will work well with the sample
      sql database in sample/*/sample_database.sql.  Read that file for more
      details on the sample database.

    o Edit (or create) /etc/nsswitch.conf such that it contains at least the
      following:
        passwd: files mysql
        shadow: files mysql
        group:  files mysql

      Do not enter the 'shadow' line on any system except Linux.
      If you don't want groups from MySQL, simply don't include 'mysql' in 
      in the 'group' line.
