    * sample/nss_mysql.cfg: Added new debug_flags to [global] section

    * nss_support.c: Moved MySQL state information here.  This means that
      ALL functions share the same state information (unlike before).  So
      it's possible for poor code to step on it's own *ent routines; I
      found the glibc library uses the same state information for all
      functions, so I felt comfortable with this move.  I may be proven
      wrong though ...
      Added a few functions so above state information can be accessed/set
      outside this source file.
      set ERANGE outside of find_eol
      Assume that buffer and structure are not NULL (nss_mysql.c now ensures
      this)
      CLOSE_ALL -> CLOSE_LINK; CLOSE_LINK now also CLOSE_RESULT's
      Removed unnecessary \n's on debug lines
      Check/set return types using enumerated constants instead of 0's and 1's
      _nss_mysql_log_error changed to _nss_mysql_log with prio arg
      removed debug - it's now in nss_mysql.c

    * nss_mysql.h: Moved syslog.h here
      Removed unused FSIZ macro
      Removed unused D_ERROR; renumbered D_* defines
      Removed unnecessary CLOSE_ALL.  CLOSE_LINK must CLOSE_RESULT anyway
      Removed unnecessary \n's on debug lines
      Added #defines for some configuration defaults
      Lots of new comments
      Added boolean and return types so we check/set returns via enumurated
      constants instead of 0's and 1's ...
      Added debug_flags to conf.global
      Rearranged some stuff for better readability

    * nss_mysql.c: The ONLY static variable is conf now.  All MySQL static
      information moved to nss_support.c
      Removed unnecessary \n's on debug lines
      Added _nss_mysql_log (replaces _nss_mysql_log_error)
      Set config defaults based on #defines in nss_mysql.h
      Debug logs to syslog instead of a file now

    * nss_config.c: Added "debug_flags" to config
      Removed unnecessary \n's on debug lines
      _nss_mysql_log_error changed to _nss_mysql_log with priority argument
      Use enumerated constants for checking/setting return types
      Set config defaults based on #defines in nss_mysql.h

    * config.h.in: Added missing HAVE_LOG_AUTHPRIV

    * acconfig.h, configure, configure.in: Debugging goes to syslog now.
      No need for DEBUG_FILE

    * TODO: I actually did a couple things on my list

    * README: Debugging method changed.  Updated dox to reflect that.

    * nss_support.c: Syslogging moved to configurable component.  Moved
      _nss_mysql_log_error to nss_mysql.c

    * nss_mysql.h: Syslogging moved to configurable component

    * nss_mysql.c: Added function enter/exit debugging.  Moved
      _nss_mysql_log_error from nss_support.c to here

    * nss_config.c: Added support for syslog facility/priority from config file

    * acconfig.h, configure, configure.in: Added HAVE_LOG_AUTHPRIV

    * sample/nss_mysql.cfg: Added new facility & priority options

    * nss_config.c: Formatting

    * configure, configure.in: Added license and revision info.  Version
      updated to 0.2d (in-development)

    * config.h.in, acconfig.h: Better name for what is now HAVE___FUNC__

    * Makefile.am, Makefile.in: License and revision info

    * TODO: Let everyone know how I plan to take over the world

    * AUTHORS, ChangeLog, NEWS, README: First-pass

    * sample/nss_mysql_root.cfg: Added missing [server] entry

    * Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Additional file to dist

    * FAQ: New file.

    * sample/nss_mysql_root.cfg: changed default password

2002-05-28  Ben Goodwin  <ben@localhost>

    * *: Tag/Release 0.1

    * Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Specify files in the sample directory to
      keep 'make dist' from adding CVS files to the distfile

    * configure.in, configure: Added CVS revision tag

    * Makefile.in: This should have been 1.1.1.1; Makefile.am was edited
      but automake was never run.  Oops ..

    * nss_mysql.h, nss_support.c, nss_structures.c: Added license and rcsid
      string

    * nss_mysql.c: Added license and rcsid string.  Fixed some formatting
      issues

    * nss_config.c: Added license and rcsid string

    * *: Initial import of nss-mysql
