This directory contains two sample configuration files that are installed
by default (if you don't already have existing configuration files), as
well as a sample database that matches these configuration files.  If you're
new to this module, I recommend starting with these and getting your system
to the point where you can log in as 'cinergi' with a password of 'cinergi'

There are also some subdirectories to help you explore other configuration
options.  Remember, since you can specify the MySQL queries directly in
the configuration, you can set up your database just about any way
you like!
